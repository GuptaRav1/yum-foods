# Yum Foods üç≤

#### Welcome to **Yum Foods**! This project is a modern, responsive food ordering website built with **React.js** as part of the *Namaste React* course by Akshay Saini, founder of [NamasteDev.com](https://namastedev.com). 

This course taught me the essentials of React, including setting up a scalable project, handling asynchronous data, and managing state across components, all of which helped bring Yum Foods to life. Dive in to explore the repo and see how this application was crafted!

## üî• Features of Yum Foods

- **Interactive UI**: Built using React components, making the interface modular and reusable.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Menu Filtering**: Dynamic filtering to browse and find the exact dish you're craving.
- **Real-time Data Fetching**: Using `fetch` and `async/await` to retrieve real-time data from an API.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Utilized React Router to make the site smooth and fast with client-side routing.
- **Optimized Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and other optimizations for a snappy user experience.
- **State Management**: Managed application-wide state using `useState` and `useReducer`.

## üìö What I Learned

### 1. **React Basics**
   - **JSX and Components**: Created modular, reusable components with JSX, which helped to build and maintain a scalable codebase.
   - **Props and State**: Used props to pass data between components and state to handle data changes within components.
   - **Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)**: Learned how to manage component state and lifecycle events, including the powerful `useEffect` hook for side effects.

### 2. **Project Structure and Setup**
   - **Folder Structure**: Organized files and components into a clean folder structure for easy navigation and maintainability.
   - **Development Environment**: Configured the project with development tools and optimized it for a smooth development workflow.
   
### 3. **Routing and Navigation**
   - **React Router**: Implemented client-side routing to create a SPA experience, handling navigation without page reloads.
   - **Dynamic Routing**: Set up dynamic routes to render specific content based on parameters (e.g., `/menu/:categoryId`).

### 4. **Asynchronous Data Fetching**
   - **Fetch API and Async/Await**: Leveraged JavaScript‚Äôs Fetch API to retrieve real-time data, handle responses, and update the UI dynamically.
   - **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience even during network issues.

### 5. **State Management**
   - **Local and Global State**: Managed state at both component level (`useState`) and global level (`useReducer`) for larger application state.
   - **Context API**: Used the Context API to pass data across deeply nested components without prop drilling.

### 6. **Optimization Techniques**
   - **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting**: Learned the concepts of code-splitting and lazy loading to reduce initial load time.
   - **Debouncing and Throttling**: Added debouncing to search functionality for better performance.
   
### 7. **Styling**
   - **CSS Modules and Styled Components**: Used CSS modules for scoped styling and Styled Components for dynamic styling based on props.

### 8. **Deployment**
   - **Deployment with Vercel/Netlify**: Deployed the application on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for easy access and demo purposes.
